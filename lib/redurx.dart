/// Nomi Modifications:
/// - Basically rebuilt the entire fucking thing to support two additional
///   goals: simultaneously running multiple actions with asynchronous calls,
///   and composition of actions. This primarily demands that state is passed
///   into reducers for updates only AFTER asynchronous calls, through
///   middleware, are injected into the action. Probably spent a week finding a
///   generalized solution that doesn't have race failures >_<
